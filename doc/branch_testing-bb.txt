Stable.  Works well to put out a message via
the UART TX pin.

The RX pin is largely ignored (it is ready to
do something interesting).

D11 is ready to signal the developer for mixed duties.
D13 is ready (and operational) to operate the onboard
LED of Feather M4 Express.

NVIC readiness is unknown.
