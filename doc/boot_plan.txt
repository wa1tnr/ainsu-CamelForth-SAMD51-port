The RESET button on Metro M4 can be toggled by a machine.

That puts it into a state where it can receive code
via bossac, without further help.

gpio can be used (one way or another) to toggle that
RESET pin.

Plan B: find an NVIC instance that accesses the part of
the firmware that handles the double-click event on the
reset pin, and activate it from inside the Forth 
interpreter.
