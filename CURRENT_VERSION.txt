On branch KM_converser_d51

Latest bare metal code - ported to Metro M4 Express,
from recent work done with Feather M0 Express (samd21).

Similarly-named repositories.

Base code is repurposed from earlier samd51 work (to
get the clocks and USART going, quickly).

This is the very first USART code for Metro M4 Express,
from wa1tnr (23 August 2018).

Has the nice integer-driven command interpreter
(211 and 911 menu).
