There's lots left TODO ;)


The dump word needs reworking (it is commented out, and
is found in forth.c).


USART_GATEWAY.C

The usart_gateway.c file has overgrown its purpose - the
ansi escape codes need to be split from it.

This file began as examples/driver_examples.c

Definitely has code written by Atmel in it. ;)

Yes.  Here's the early driver_examples.c code from Atmel Start:

#include "driver_examples.h"
#include "driver_init.h"
#include "utils.h"
 /**
 * Example of using USART_5 to write "Hello World" using the IO abstraction.
 */
void USART_5_example(void)
{
	struct io_descriptor *io;
	usart_sync_get_io_descriptor(&USART_5, &io);
	usart_sync_enable(&USART_5);
 	io_write(io, (uint8_t *)"Hello World!", 12);
}
